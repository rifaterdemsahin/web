This file is a placeholder for a screenshot of the courses page (courses.html).
It should depict:
- The navigation bar at the top.
- A header section with a title ("Delivery Pilot Showcase") and subtitle.
- A grid of course cards, each showing an icon, category, title, description, duration, level, and enrollment buttons.
- A "Coming Soon" section with a newsletter signup form.
- The overall layout should be clean, modern, and professional, using the color scheme defined in common-styles.css.
