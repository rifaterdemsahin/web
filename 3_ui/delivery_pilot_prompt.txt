This file is a placeholder for a screenshot of the Delivery Pilot page (delivery-pilot.html).
It should depict:
- The navigation bar at the top with "Delivery Pilot" active.
- A Hero section with a gradient background, title "Delivery Pilot", subtitle, and CTA buttons.
- A "Product Showcase" with an icon and tagline.
- Features grid showing benefits like "AI-Powered Learning", "Hands-on Experience", etc.
- A Process section showing steps (e.g., Assessment, Custom Plan, Implementation).
- A Pricing section with cards for "Prosumer", "Starter", and "Professional & Enterprise" plans.
- A GitHub Assessment section with a form to submit a repository for analysis.
- A final CTA section.
- The design should be vibrant, using the primary blue/purple gradient theme, looking like a SaaS landing page.
