This file is a placeholder for a screenshot of the Early Bird Registration page (early-bird-registration.html).
It should depict:
- The navigation bar at the top with "Early Bird" active.
- A page header titled "Bridge the AI Skills Gap Early! 🚀".
- A registration form card with fields for Email and a checklist of "Interested In" courses.
- A "Join Early Bird List" button.
- A "Course Benefits" section with cards for "Early Access", "Special Pricing", "Comprehensive Content", etc.
- The design should be conversion-focused, using the primary gradient theme.
