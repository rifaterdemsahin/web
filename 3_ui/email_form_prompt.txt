This file is a placeholder for a screenshot of the Coupon/Email Form page (email-form.html).
It should depict:
- A centered form container on a gradient background with a subtle grain texture.
- An animated icon at the top.
- A headline "Bridge the AI Skills Gap! 🚀".
- A "Course Preview" box showing the current course title.
- An email input field and a "Get My Coupon Code" submit button.
- A "What you'll get" benefits list with checkmarks.
- The design should be attractive and high-converting, similar to a landing page for a special offer.
