This file is a placeholder for a screenshot of the Newsletter Subscription page (newsletter.html).
It should depict:
- A page header "Join the AI Skills Revolution! 🚀".
- A split-layout main section:
    - Left: A detailed subscription form (Name, Email, Primary Interest dropdown, Privacy checkbox).
    - Right: An info panel showing "What You'll Get" (list), "Newsletter Stats" (grid), and "Why Subscribe" text.
- A "Latest from the Blog" section at the bottom with post cards.
- The design should be clean, structured, and emphasize the value of subscribing.
